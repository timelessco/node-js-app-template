# Introduction

This project is a frontend playground template built using nodemon. nodemon is a
watch tool for modern node applications, designed for performance and ease of
use. It allows you to focus on writing code and not on the watch process.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/timelessco/node-js-playground-template
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
pnpm run dev
```

This will start a nodemon watch server, and you can view the changes in your
cli. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the cli.

## Other Commands

In addition to the dev and build commands, there may be other commands
available, such as:

`check`: Run the linters & formatters to check the code for style and syntax
errors.
